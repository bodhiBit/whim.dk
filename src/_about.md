My name is Tommy Pedersen and I study multimedia design at the academy. I have a life time experience with computers and programming and had only just learned to read and write when I learned BASIC on contemporary micro-computers such as the ZX Spectrum and Amiga. As a result, I am a bit of an old geek with a nostalgic interest, particularly chiptune music, demoscene and Star Trek.

Although I have experience with a fair amount of programming languages, it is primarily the web that interests me. I have a firm belief that the apps of the future are web apps, which the development of web technologies in recent years largely confirms. Therefore I have immersed myself in web development especially JavaScript and node.js.

I like to collaborate on a project that everyone in the group is passionate about and where you know and respect each other's strengths and weaknesses. I might not be the most social type, but on the other hand I'm good at solving technical problems, provide ideas and help others.

I consider code as an artform more than just a craft; more a paintbrush than a hammer. Code (especially web code) is a means for expressing ideas, feelings, thoughts, experiences etc. not only in the product, but also in the code itself. It's a living substance to be treated with care and in return it will help you get your message out in the world! :)
