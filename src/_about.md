My name is Tommy Pedersen and I study multimedia design at the academy. I have a life time experience with computers and programming and had only just learned to read and write when I learned BASIC on contemporary micro-computers such as the ZX Spectrum and Amiga. As a result, I am a bit of an old geek with a nostalgic interest, particularly chiptune music, demoscene and Star Trek.

Although I have experience with a fair amount of programming languages, it is primarily the web that interests me. I have a firm belief that the apps of the future are web apps, which the development of web technologies in recent years largely confirms. Therefore I have immersed myself in web development especially JavaScript and node.js.

I have chosen to read multimedia design with the expectation of learning how to become better at design and use my skills and experience to create beautiful web pages that users are happy to use.

I like to collaborate on a project that everyone in the group is passionate about and where you know and respect each other's strengths and weaknesses. Maybe I'm not the most social type, but on the other hand I'm good at solving technical problems, provide ideas and help others.
